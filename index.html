        It's time that I explain my love for Lucy Lawless a little. Facebook suddenly started flooding me with ads for gay and lesbian dating - tells you a lot about what FB is reading into the things you post on your timeline. I find it quite amusing and my friends also know the joke: If Lucy Lawless ever came my way, left her husband and decided that she wanted to have me at her side, I would not even think about saying "no"! ;) I think, I just have quite a healthy admiration for someone who helped me to discover a lot about myself. Nothing wrong with that - and with some jokes!
